# Solving linear systems

Solve the following linear systems with 3 variables:  

### 1

\(4a + 2b + 3c = 5\)  
\(-2b + 5c = -9\)  
\(6c = -6\)  

### 2

\(5x + 3y + 2z = 15\)  
\(2y + 4z = 24\)  
\(y - 4z = -42\)  

### 3

\(3x + y + 3z = -2\)  
\(6x + 2y + 9z = 5\)  
\(-2x - y - z = 3\)

# Linear Algebra

**1.** In summer Katie decided to go on a hike in the mountains. Her
journey can be described by three displacement vectors (distance and
direction) \(\mathbf{d_1}\), \(\mathbf{d_2}\) and \(\mathbf{d_3}\).  
  
\(\mathbf{d_1} = (7, 8)\)  
\(\mathbf{d_2} = (6, 2)\)  
\(\mathbf{d_3} = (2, 9)\)  
  
Distances are given in kilometers.  
  
How far is Katie from home at the end of her hike? What overall
direction did she walk in?  
**2.** Multiply the following matrices:  
\[\begin{bmatrix}
    4 & 2 & 3 \\
    2 & 1 & 5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\times
\begin{bmatrix}
    -3 & 6\\
    3 & -5\\
    -4 & 3
\end{bmatrix}\]  
**3.** Figure out possible values the second matrix so that the equation
is correct:  
\[\begin{bmatrix}
    7 & 2 \\
    3 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\times
\begin{bmatrix}
    ?\\
    ?
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    4\\
    1\\
\end{bmatrix}\]  
**4.** How many rows and columns should matrix B have so that the
multiplication is valid?  
\[\begin{bmatrix}
    3 & -6 & 1 & 2\\
    4 & 1 & -1 & 2\\
\end{bmatrix}
\times
B
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    4 & 1\\
    1 & 5\\
\end{bmatrix}\]  
**5.** Bring the following matrix into row-echelon form. Then bring it
into reduced row-echelon form.  
\[\begin{bmatrix}
    2 & 4 & 2\\
    1 & 3 & 3\\
    0 & 2 & 2\\
\end{bmatrix}\]

# Transformations

### 1\.

Create a translation matrix that will move a 3D point by (3, 5, -7).
Apply it to such a point to check your answer.

### 2\.

![Test Subject](../assets/images/assignment4/Smiley.png)

What type of transformation is the following matrix responsible for?
Sketch what it would do to our test subject.  
\[\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0\\
    0 & -1\\
\end{bmatrix}\]

### 3\.

What type of transformation is the following matrix responsible for?
Sketch what it would do to our test subject.  
\[\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2\\
    0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\]

### 4\.

What type of transformation is the following matrix responsible for? On
which axis? Sketch what it would do to our test subject.  
\[\begin{bmatrix}
    0.707 & -0.707 & 0\\
    0.707 & 0.707 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\]

### 5\.

We are drawing a 3D bunny on screen, but would like to make it twice as
big and rotate it by 180 degrees on the X-axis. Form a single matrix to
perform this operation.  

# Shading

From a light located at position (-2, 3) a light beam hits a surface at
(0, 0). The surface has a normal vector of (0, 1).  
  
**1.** Assuming perfect mirror reflection what direction will the beam
reflect in?  
  
**2.** What direction would the light reflect in if the surface were
rotated counter-clockwise by 10 degrees?  
  
**3.** Assuming the light source only emits purple light, and after
reflecting off the surface only red light remains. What colour would the
surface have to an observer?  
  
**4.** What colour would the surface have if the light were blue?  
  
**5.** Assuming white light and a perfectly diffuse surface which does
not absorb light and has the original normal vector. An observer is
looking at the surface from the point (1, 3). What fraction of light
reaching the surface would reach an observer?  
  
**6.** In the Phong reflection model where the surface has a shininess
factor (n) of 32, would the observer see a specular highlight at this
position on the surface?  
  
**7.** Visually demonstrate why the equation for calculating the
reflection vector works in the case of the light direction pointing
toward the surface, and of it pointing toward the light.
